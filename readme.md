# FEATURES & User Stories
Sorting Algorithm visualizer, for helping Software Engineering Students understand and nail common algorithms.

MVP Features and User Stories are outlined below, along with some stretch goals/features that we hope to eventually incorporate.

## Features - MVP
- [ ] Sorting algorithms: Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort Algorithm Visualizations
- [ ] Pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search
    - [ ] Ability to add "walls" to grid and have pathfinders take these walls into account
- [ ] Sliding scales for changing array size and speed
- [ ] Generate New Array button

## User Stories
- As a software engineering student, I want to be able visualize common sorting algorithms in order to understand them at a high level.

## Backlog
- [ ] Darkmode
- [ ] User comments below each Algo sorted by newest
    - [ ] Up/Downvoting like Reddit



## Frontend Routes
- /
- /pathfinding

## React Components
- Basic divs, buttons, sliders
- Basic hooks of useEffect, useState
